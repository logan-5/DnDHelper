# DnDHelper
Nerdiest repo ever?  iOS app I wrote to help me while DMing a Dungeons and Dragons quest.  Swift 2.

Keep track of your players (my campaign's players are baked into the source code), add new ones, store them so you don't forget your friends' weird fantasy names.  Then bring them over and start an encounter, where you can add any combination of players and NPC's, keeping track of initiative order as well as NPC hitpoints.

iPad recommended; iPhone supported.  iOS 7+ (because Swift).
